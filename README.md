## Exercises

Each of the files in this repo is meant as a series of exercises. Javascript has been written for each of the files and your assignment (should you choose to accept it) is to convert the commented out JS into Python code.

You may run your files by running `python -i 01-variables.py` or `python -i 01-variables.py` (replace `01-variables.py` with the name of the file you'd like to run). This will enter an interactive repl where you can test your variables and code after you've already written it. You may exit the interactive repl with `CTRL + D` or by typing `exit()`.

The `additional-exercises.py` file is meant as an additional challenge without Javascript to guide you. Follow the deliverables and see if you can build out these challenges one at a time.

As a reminder of best coding habits, test your code as you go and don't move on to a deliverable or line until you feel comfortable that you've accomplished the previous one. *Never make assumptions without testing them!*
